Automated regression tests for librdkafka
=========================================

A local configuration file needs to be created to specify the broker address,
and possibly other rdkafka configuration properties:

    cp test.conf.example test.conf
    $EDITOR test.conf


To run tests:

   # Run tests in parallel (quickest, but harder to troubleshoot)
   make

   # Run tests in sequence
   make run_seq

   # Run specific test
   TESTS=0004 make

   # Run test(s) with helgrind, valgrind, gdb
   TESTS=0009 ./run-test.sh ./merged valgrind|helgrind|gdb


All tests in the 0000-0999 series are run automatically with 'make'.

Tests 1000-1999 are subject to specific non-standard setups or broker
configuration, these tests are run with "TESTS=1xxx-yyyyy.test make".
See comments in the test's source file for specific requirements.
