Automated regression tests for librdkafka
=========================================

A local configuration file needs to be created to specify the broker address,
and possibly other rdkafka configuration properties:

    cp test.conf.example test.conf
    $EDITOR test.conf


To run tests:

   # Run tests in parallel (quickest, but harder to troubleshoot)
   make

   # Run tests in sequence
   make run_seq

   # Run specific test
   TESTS=0004 make

   # Run test(s) with helgrind, valgrind, gdb
   TESTS=0009 ./run-test.sh ./merged valgrind|helgrind|gdb


All tests in the 0000-0999 series are run automatically with 'make'.

Tests 1000-1999 are subject to specific non-standard setups or broker
configuration, these tests are run with "TESTS=1xxx-yyyyy.test make".
See comments in the test's source file for specific requirements.




To insert test results into SQLite database make sure the 'sqlite3' utility
is installed, then add this to test.conf:

test.sql.command=sqlite3 rdktests
